Three focus areas of our project:

-- Fine-grained extraction: Utilizing language models to extract granular information and relations from randomized clinical trials.
-- Working with full text: Assessing LLMs' capability to understand and extract information from the full text of randomized control trials.
-- Personalized intervention recommendation: Evaluating the use of LLMs as conversational agents to recommend interventions. Specifically focused on their ability to answer questions, maintain conversation, and provide grounded information.
