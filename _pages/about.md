## Introduction
<img src="/images/ncsa_talk.jpg" alt="Giving Talk NCSA student Conference" style=" float: right; width: 200px;"/>
I am Rohan Charudatt Salvi, an aspiring NLP researcher and a recent master's graduate from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My passion for NLP drives my research and professional pursuits. 

Equipped with a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, R, C++ and topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms. I have also developed a growing skillset in NLP, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.

## Personal & Professional Mission 🌐

My research ultimately bridges the gap between technological innovation and societal needs, ensuring our advancements meet people's requirements and are as inclusive as they are groundbreaking. I explore how we can employ information extraction and conversational agents to enhance access to meaningful information across domains. While developing models for such real-world applications, I am also keen to understand these models from a societal viewpoint, assessing their biases and finding ways to ensure fairness through equitability and reliability. 

## Academic Background 📚
From my formative years at VNIT, Nagpur, to my recent academic accomplishments at UIUC, my journey has been a consistent pursuit of knowledge and innovation in technology. My diverse work experiences, ranging from research internships to engineering roles, have seen me address complex challenges in NLP and develop data-driven solutions. This wide array of experiences has equipped me with a strong technical foundation and a versatile problem-solving approach, making me well-prepared for the rigorous demands of a Ph.D. program. 


## Connect With Me 🤝
I’m always eager to connect with fellow professionals and enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out for discussions, collaborations, or just a friendly chat about the latest in AI and language processing.
