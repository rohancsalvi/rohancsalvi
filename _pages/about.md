🧑‍💻 I am a graduate research assistant at UIUC 

🔬 My research interest is NLP

👩‍🏫 I am currently working with Prof. Catherine Blake on the use of LLM for precision medicine and Prof. Nigel Bosch on social bias in LLM

## Introduction
I am an aspiring researcher passionate about harnessing the power of human-AI collaborative natural language processing models for social good. My skills encompass a range of technologies including C++, Python, JAVA, Hadoop, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning algorithms, and Data Structures.

## Professional Focus 🔍
I want to pursue a Ph.D. program, focusing on the intricate relationship between human behavioral alignment and language models, and their influence on social decision-making. I believe that understanding this dynamic is key to developing AI technologies that can positively impact our society.

## Personal Mission 🌐
Driven by a commitment to social betterment, I aim to contribute to the field by developing AI models that not only understand but also empathize with human linguistic nuances. I envision a future where technology and humanity collaborate seamlessly to address complex social challenges.

## Academic Background 📚
I completed my Master’s degree at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, where I delved deep into computational social science. My time there was marked by several exciting projects, particularly in enhancing online mental health platforms through advanced language processing techniques. These experiences have provided me with a robust foundation in computational methods and a comprehensive understanding of popular language processing algorithms.

## Connect With Me 🤝
I’m always eager to connect with fellow professionals and enthusiasts in the field. Feel free to reach out for discussions, collaborations, or just a friendly chat about the latest in AI and language processing.
